*note* This web app is made to work on a live website through goDaddy and cPanel. In order for it to sync correctly with cPanel, the index.html file has to leave out the "Images" folder tag from the src of each image in the document - which is necessary for it to work otherwise, such as when it's downloaded from GitHub. To get the images to work in such an instance, simply add "Images" to the beginning of the src of each image in the index.html document. 
	Example: src="/leftArrow.png" --> src="Images/leftArrow.png"

Aside from looking up the average roadblock via Google, all of this was done by me with HTML5, CSS, and Javascript on an Eclipse IDE within a VM made with Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager. The OS used was Ubuntu.
